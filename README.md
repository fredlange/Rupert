## Rupert Analytics
Using machine learning to determine daily growth in stocks.
Rupert answers the question "If I want to make a 1% ROI today. What should I by and when?"

# Notice: This is an early prototype that is outdated. Any trades are on your own risk!

Default stocklist is OMX-ST-30 (30 greatest companies on Stockholm Stock Exchange)
Feel free to add whatever stock tickers you want.

# Notice: You need to setup your own datastorage.
Currently Rupert is using Yahoo chart api for demonstation only. This is not OK to use in any situation. Use on your own risk.
You need to make your on data handler to download and send data as a pandas dataframe to calculating classes.
